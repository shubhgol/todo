## TODO App
it is todo App.we can add todo in todo list. when we onclick on todo item, then it is toggle from status inprogress to completed and vice versa.


#### TECH Stack
  React
  Typescript
  Html & Css


#### Package & WHY?
  we are using https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid package to give each todo has own unique id. we can use index base id instead of shortid
  but we got warning issue of same key and it might be behave inconsistenly in some cases that' s why we are using this package


#### FUTURE SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT

  Unit testing
  
  remove all inline style and use classes and seprate css file
